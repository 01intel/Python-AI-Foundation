Python AI Foundation
Overview

This repository documents my structured journey in mastering Python from first principles, with the long-term goal of building strong foundations for Artificial Intelligence, automation, and systems engineering.

The focus of this project is not just writing code — but understanding how Python works internally, how problems are structured, and how to think like an engineer.

This repository will evolve progressively from:

Core Python fundamentals

Control flow and functions

Data structures and algorithms

File handling and automation

Object-Oriented Programming

Applied scripting

Preparation for Machine Learning and AI

Philosophy

Strong AI skills require strong foundations.

Before diving into Machine Learning, Deep Learning, or frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow, this repository focuses on:

Clean logic

Structured thinking

Readable code

Reproducible experiments

Real-world automation practice

The goal is long-term technical mastery, not shortcut learning.
